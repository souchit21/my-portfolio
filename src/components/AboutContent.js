        <p>
          Hello readers! I am Souchit Kumar, a final year undergrad from IIT Bombay. I love to solve problems and to learn and build new 
          challenging and exciting things. I am a skilled full stack web developer and have work experience of more than one year with MERN stack!
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a great enriching experience at my internship at Menon and Menon as junior software developer where I got the opportunity 
          to create a web portal to perform all audit related activities on one interface. I was awarded Letter of Recommendation for my 
          sincere and exceptional performance throughout my internship.
          I have also done several self projects, and each one brought me to learn new things.
          I always like to learn new stuffs and building things with them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Being creative and perpetual learner by heart, motivates me to pursue software development.
          I am looking for the role which let me dive deep into software development and learn 
          continuously in the dynamic environment. I get myself ready to embrace obstacles and find 
          solutions to any issues that may come up while learning through any medium.
